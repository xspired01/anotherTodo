# Summary

This is a simple Awesome Todo app with React, but no Redux. Just practicing passing state & props from different components, font awesome, and CSS. This is based on a few tutorials. CSS is a mix from a tutorial and code pens. The Edit Todo field is pre-populated with data from that task, which is different from some other input forms which usually just ask for input and the fields are blank. 

NOTE: This is master branch. The feature branches will have other options. 
If you want to look at hoos, there is a hooks feature branch that uses hooks in the Todo app (Hooks are basically an easier way to "hook" into state without a class component and associated verbiage). The readme file summarizes the key points about the Todo app and gives a brief description of hooks, general use and structure, limitations, and syntax. 

## Instructions

Basically, write in a new task in the Add Todo field and press "ADD TODO" button. The new task is added at the bottom of the "REMOVE COMPLETED TODOS" button. You can mark a task as COMPLETE (grey and strike through) the tasks by simply clicking on them. Click the icons next to the tasks to either EDIT or DELETE.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
